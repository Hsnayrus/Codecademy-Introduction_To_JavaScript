# What is JavaScript?

* JavaScript is a powerful language which helps build dynamic web pages.

# Console

* The `console` keyword in JavaScript is an object which contains various functions and other data. 
* One of these functions is `.log()`, which helps print or log something to the console.
* The `console.log()` method is the JavaScript equivalent of python's `print()` function or C++'s `std::cout` function.
* The following statement prints '5' to the console:
```
console.log(5);
```
* You might have noticed a semicolon<b><i>(i)</i></b> at the end of the statement. Semicolons in JavaScript are _optional_, however, it is recommended to use semicolons.
